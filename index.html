                From providing only fixed-space rental options, they wanted to add item-based storage subscription facilities, where clients could store individual items without renting the entire storage unit.

              <p class="txt">
                This was envisaged to enable clients to purchase a storage unit online and transfer storable items (back and forth) right from the comfort of their homes.

                Vaultra was operating with an elementary static website that simply listed the different variations of storage units and their renting prices.

              <p class="txt">
                It didn’t have any dynamic facilities to show real-time pick-up appointment availabilities for the door-to-door service.

                The existing structure only allowed clients to purchase a unit from the website at listed prices and unlock an access code that could be used during their rental period.

                They needed a technological website upgrade that was intuitive for users to navigate through their storage needs efficiently. Moreover, they also required a

                the provision of door-to-door storage facilities and item based, bin rental and self-storage services. 
                For this, Java and React was used and AWS was chosen for hosting the cloud services.
