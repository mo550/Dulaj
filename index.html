              Vaultra sought to elevate its value and expand its service portfolio by introducing several new storage options for its clientele.

              From providing only fixed-space rental options, they wanted to add item-based storage subscription facilities, where clients could store individual items without renting the entire storage unit.

            <p class="txt">
              This was envisaged to enable clients to purchase a storage unit online and transfer storable items (back and forth) right from the comfort of their homes.

              Vaultra was operating with an elementary static website that simply listed the different variations of storage units and their renting prices.<br> 
              The existing structure only allowed clients to purchase a unit from the website at listed prices and unlock an access code that could be used 
              during their rental period.

              It didn’t have any dynamic facilities to show real-time pick-up appointment availabilities for the door-to-door service.<br>
              Moreover, for the space subscription charges options for varying storage requirements, there was no fluid infrastructure to support the same.<br>
              They needed a technological website upgrade that was intuitive for users to navigate through their storage needs efficiently. Moreover, they also 
              required a solid backend to deliver the best customer experience while supporting the Vaultra staff with a smooth, error-free workflow.
